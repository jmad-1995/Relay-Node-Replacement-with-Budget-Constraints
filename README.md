# Relay-Node-Replacement-with-Budget-Constraints
Placement of the relay nodes in such a manner that the new graph G’ = (V’, E’) is as connected as possible making it a connectedness-maximization problem. 
We have taken two definitions of correctness which have separate problem formulation from the paper.
Budget Constrained Relay node Placement with Minimum Number of Connected Components (BCRP-MNCC)
Budget Constrained Relay node Placement with Maximum size of Largest Connected Component (BCRP-MLCC) 
The above two problems are special cases of the STP-MSP problem. 
The paper tries to find approximate heuristic-based solutions using a Minimum Spanning Tree approach which we have tried to implement in code.
